--- Prereq ---
1) Download the word embeddings from this link. Unzip and save the file into the project directory at the same level as main.py:

https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim/blob/master/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300-SLIM.bin.gz


2) Download the required packages mentioned in requirements.txt. The format of the requirements.txt file is for Conda. Please install Conda if necessary.


--- Structure ---
The data folder contains the movie data from Kaggle used for this project(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)

--- To run --- 

Run 'python main.py' to run the classifier. The main.py files contains runs of the classifier with various parameter settings. You can uncomment these and modify them as necessary.

If you want to visualize your results, first edit main.py as you wish. Then you can run 'python main.py > Plots/plot_data.txt'. Now, you can copy the data from plot_data.txt into plot.py to use for the graphs.
